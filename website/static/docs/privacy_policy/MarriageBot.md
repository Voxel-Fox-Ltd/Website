# Privacy Policy

MarriageBot is run by Voxel Fox Ltd, trading as Voxel Fox (UK company number 12467253).

The following describes the data stored by MarriageBot. 

## Why we collect and use data

Collecting data is necessary in order to make the bot run properly. Without storing some aspects of your user data, the bot would not be able to run.

## What data is collected

We collect the following:

* **User IDs**

    This is used so that we can keep track of your parent, children, and partner(s).

    This is also so that we can keep track of your customisations (such as changing the colours used when your family tree is generated).

    This is also so we can keep track of users you have blocked.

    This is also so we can track your premium subscription status.

* **Usernames and discriminators**

    This is used so that a user's name can be put into the family tree without having to explicitly ask Discord what your name is.

* **Guild IDs**

    This is so we can track guild customisations (such as prefix changes).

    This is also so that we can track Gold payments.

* **Channel IDs**

    This is so that channel overrides can be saved (such as disabling commands within certain channels).

* **Role IDs**

    This is so that children count overrides can be stored.

## Where data is stored and secured

Data that we collect is stored in a database. This database is not accessible by other entities. The server that the database is kept on is secure, and its hard drive is encrypted.

## Where data is shared

Raw data is not shared with other entities. Generated trees are posted publicly on Discord, and contain your username and discriminator. 

## Concerns

If you have any concerns about the usage of your data, please [contact us](mailto:privacy@voxelfox.co.uk?subject=Privacy%20Policy%20Concern).
