## Why we collect and use data

Collecting data is necessary in order to make the bot run properly. Without storing some aspects of your user data, the bot would not be able to run.

## What data is collected

We collect the following: 

* **User IDs**

    This is used to keep track of messages you've sent, how long you have been in voice channels, and activity in a Minecraft server (if used).

* **Guild IDs**

    This is to keep track of guild settings, and where activity and experience can be tracked and validated. This also is to keep track of the guild customisations (such as the prefix).

* **Channel IDs**

    This is to keep track of where messages are sent and if certain commands can be executed, or if there are override settings in place.

* **Role IDs**

    This is to keep track of the roles a user has. This also is used to keep track of when to add a role to a user.

## Where data is stored and secured

Data that we collect is stored in a database. This database is not accessible by other entities. The server that the database is kept on is secure, and its hard drive is encrypted.

## Where data is shared

Raw data is not shared with other entities.
