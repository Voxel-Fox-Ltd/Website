# Privacy Policy

Honey is run by Voxel Fox Ltd, trading as Voxel Fox (UK company number 12467253). The following describes the data stored by Honey.

## Why we collect and use data

Collecting data is necessary in order to make the bot run properly. Without storing some aspects of your user data, the bot would not be able to run.

## What data is collected

We collect the following: 

* **User IDs** 

    This is used so that we can keep track of your fursona information; which items you have purchased; how many coins you have; and for customisations (such as changing your fursona information, and so on). This is also to keep track of what fursonas you have created.

    Your ID is also stored when an infraction (such as kicks, bans, and warns) is created for your user.

* **Guild IDs**

    Guild IDs are stored to determine permissions for users, as well as customisations in a guild, and infractions per user.

* **Channel IDs**

    These are stored when logging channels are set (such as message delete logs, ban logs, etc).

* **Role IDs**

    This is to track temporary roles for a user, or when the bot has to add them to a user (such as a mute role). This also can be used to determine if you can customise your roles.

## Where data is stored and secured

Data that we collect is stored in a database. This database is not accessible by other entities. The server that the database is kept on is secure, and its hard drive is encrypted.

## Where data is shared

Raw data is not shared with other entities. Fursona information and bios are posted publicly on Discord, and contain your username and discriminator.

## Concerns

If you have any concerns about the usage of your data, please [contact us](mailto:privacy@voxelfox.co.uk?subject=Privacy%20Policy%20Concern).
