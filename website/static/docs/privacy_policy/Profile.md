# Privacy Policy

Profile is run by Voxel Fox Ltd, trading as Voxel Fox (UK company number 12467253). The following describes the data stored by Profile.

## Why we collect and use data

Collecting data is necessary in order to make the bot run properly. Without storing some aspects of your user data, the bot would not be able to run.

## What data is collected

We collect the following:

* **User IDs**

    This is to keep track of your profile information, including what profiles you've filled out.

* **Guild IDs**

    This is used to keep track of templates that each guild has created, as well as information like a maximum number of templates a guild can have.

* **Channel IDs**

    These are used to track where profiles can be sent to to be verified or archived.

* **Role IDs**

    These are stored when a template has a role attached to its verification procedure, ie a role to be added to a user after they are verified.

## Where data is stored and secured

Data that we collect is stored in a database. This database is not accessible by other entities. The server that the database is kept on is secure, and its hard drive is encrypted.

## Where data is shared

Raw data is not shared with other entities. Profiles are posted publicly on Discord, and contain your username and discriminator.

## Concerns

If you have any concerns about the usage of your data, please [contact us](mailto:privacy@voxelfox.co.uk?subject=Privacy%20Policy%20Concern).
