Collecting data is necessary in order to make the bot run properly. Without storing some aspects of your user data, the bot would not be able to run.

    This is used so that we can track guild customisations (such as prefix changes, or guild settings for the bot).

## Where data is stored and secured

Data that we collect is stored in a database. This database is not accessible by other entities. The server that the database is kept on is secure, and its hard drive is encrypted.
